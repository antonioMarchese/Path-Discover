# PathDiscover Visualizer

Welcome to PathDiscover Visualizer! This application is designed to help you understand various path-finding algorithms by visualizing their operations on a 2D grid. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, this tool will provide an interactive platform to explore and learn.

## Features

- Pick an Algorithm: Choose from a selection of path-finding algorithms to visualize how they find paths between two points on the grid.
- Generate Maze: Quickly create a random maze on the grid for testing and visualization purposes.
- Customize Speed: Adjust the visualization speed to your preference for better understanding.
- Clear Grid: Start fresh by clearing the grid to remove any existing nodes or walls.

## Getting Started

1. Placing Walls: Begin by selecting the "Wall Node" option. Click and drag to create walls on the grid, or use the "Generate Maze" button to create a random maze.
2. Selecting Start and Target Nodes: Choose the "Start Node" to set the starting point and the "Target Node" to set the goal.
3. Selecting an Algorithm: After setting the start and target nodes, click on the "Algorithms" button to choose an algorithm from the list.
4. Visualizing it!: Once you've selected an algorithm, click on the "Visualize" button to see how it operates in finding the shortest path.

## Tutorial

If you're new to path-finding algorithms or need a refresher, you can follow the tutorial provided within the application. The tutorial will guide you through the basic steps of using the visualizer effectively.
